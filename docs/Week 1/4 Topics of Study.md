## Data Center as a Building Block

- Previously (e.g., dot-com era)
    - Smaller in size, but made up of special purpose, expensive hardware
    - Network that was deep and narrow: a small failure and the data center
    could not be accessed
    - Predominantly meant for enterprise computing
- Today
    - Deployment of cheap, commodity hardware
    - Geographically distributed, i.e., multiple data centers
    - Network that is thin and wideâ€”ability to withstand failures better while
    keeping the system operational
    - Wide variety of applications hosted (e.g., Google search)
