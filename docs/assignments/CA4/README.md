# CA4 – Multi-Hybrid Cloud (Final)

**Goal:** Extend your end-to-end pipeline across two or more sites/clouds, ensuring secure connectivity, seamless data flow, and resilience under failure.

---

## 1. Choose Your Topology

Select one of the following patterns or develop your own and document your choice: It must include two more locations.

- **Edge → Cloud**  
  Producers run at the edge (laptop or local cluster); Kafka, processor, and DB in a public cloud.
- **Multi-Cloud**  
  Split components (e.g., Kafka + DB in AWS, processor + producers in GCP) and coordinate between them.
- **Multi-Cluster Kubernetes**  
  Two K8s clusters (could be different providers); use cross-cluster service mesh or VPN.

---

## 2. Establish Secure Connectivity

Implement one connectivity model and describe it clearly:

- **Site-to-site VPN**  
  Automate tunnel setup and routing between subnets.
- **Service Mesh** (e.g., Istio multi-cluster)  
  Configure mutual TLS and service discovery across clusters.
- **Bastion & SSH Tunnels**  
  Use a bastion host with port-forwarding (`ssh -L`); document port mappings and firewall rules.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Config snippets or CLI commands to establish connectivity
- Verification steps (ping, curl across sites, service mesh health)

---

## 3. Deploy in Each Site

- Adapt your CA2 manifests or Swarm stacks per site/cluster.
- Ensure container images are reachable (multi-arch or mirrored registry).
- Parameterize site-specific settings (subnets, DNS names, service endpoints).
- Automate deployment with a single script or Makefile that targets both environments.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Per-site/cluster manifest directory (clear naming)
- Deployment command or script and brief instructions

---

## 4. Simulate Failure & Recover

- Choose one failure scenario (e.g., take down the Kafka site, disrupt VPN).
- Perform the drill and observe:
    1. Service unavailability or errors in the dependent site.
    2. Automated or manual recovery steps you execute.
- Document actions and results in a concise runbook section.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Short video (≤4 min) showing failure injection and recovery
- Written runbook entries for incident response

---

## 5. Documentation & Submissions

1. **Architecture Diagram**
    - Show CIDRs, gateways, VPN tunnels or mesh connections, and component placement.
2. **Runbook**
    - Steps for bring-up, tear-down, and failure recovery (include commands and troubleshooting tips).
3. **Demo Video**
    - End-to-end data flow across sites and resilience drill.
4. **README.md**
    - Overview of topology, connectivity method, deployment instructions, and any deviations from CA2.
