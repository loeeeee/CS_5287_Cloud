# **Vanderbilt University – School of Engineering**

## **5287 – Cloud Computing**

**Instructor:** Dr. Darren Pulsipher
**Email:** [darren.pulsipher@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:darren.pulsipher@vanderbilt.edu)
**Meeting Time:** Thursdays, 5:00–6:30 PM CT (Online via Zoom)
**Semester:** Fall 2025

## **Course Description**

This course provides an in-depth understanding of **cloud computing concepts, architectures, and technologies** through a combination of **pre-class recorded lectures**, **weekly discussions**, **hands-on cloud assignments**, and **research presentations**.

Students will explore cloud infrastructure, virtualization, containers, orchestration, cloud-native development, serverless computing, distributed data management, AI workloads, and next-generation networking.

Instead of traditional lectures, class time will be used for **active discussions**, **breakout sessions**, and **presentations**. Students are expected to **prepare by watching videos, reading assigned materials, and completing assignments** before each session.

## **Instructor Philosophy**

Cloud computing is evolving rapidly, and employers value **applied skills, problem-solving ability, and communication skills**. This course is designed to simulate real-world learning, collaboration, and presentation experiences.

Generative AI (GenAI) will be used throughout the course to assist in **learning, creating, coding, debugging, and presentation preparation**. Students are expected to **learn how to leverage AI tools effectively and responsibly**.

## **Learning Objectives**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain cloud computing models, architectures, and services.
2. Deploy and manage workloads using virtualization, containers, and orchestration tools.
3. Apply scaling, load balancing, and reliability engineering techniques in cloud-native systems.
4. Build and deploy serverless and edge computing applications.
5. Design and implement distributed data management solutions.
6. Leverage cloud resources for AI/ML workloads.
7. Use GenAI tools effectively for technical problem-solving and presentation.
8. Communicate technical concepts clearly in both written and spoken formats.

## **Course Structure**

Each week follows this structure:

* **Before Class:** Learn the subject to be discussed in class that week

    * Explore the subject with GenAI
    * Watch 2–3 short pre-recorded lectures
    * Read assigned articles and documentation
    * Work on GitHub cloud assignments

* **During Class:**

    * Quick recap and Q\&A
    * Breakout sessions for collaborative problem-solving
    * Group presentations and discussion
    * Feedback from the instructor and peers

* **After Class:**

    * Complete and submit assignments
    * Begin preparing for the next week's topics

## **Required Tools & Resources**

* **GitHub Repo:** [Assignments and Lecutres](https://github.com/madajaju/CS5287)
* **Chameleon Cloud Account:** [Sign up](https://chameleoncloud.org/)
* **Docker Desktop** or equivalent container runtime
* **kubectl** and **Kubernetes cluster access** (provided via Chameleon Cloud)
* Generative AI tool(s) of choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

## **Use of Generative AI**

Generative AI is **required** in this course as a tool for:

* **Learning** — using AI to explain concepts, answer questions, and explore code
* **Creating** — generating starter code, diagrams, and reports
* **Presenting** — helping prepare slides, outlines, and demos

**Rules for AI Use:**

1. Always verify AI-generated content for accuracy.
2. GenAI is a people pleaser and it will lie straight to your face.
3. Disclose in your assignment write-up where and how AI was used.
4. AI may not be used to generate final code without your review and understanding.
5. Save your conversations with GenAI. Hand them in with assignments. Share them with others.

## Technology Recording Statement

The following is a general statement distributed by our University with respect to the use of Zoom
and recordings. Vanderbilt University seeks to protect the intellectual property of all our faculty,
and to safeguard the privacy of all our students in online learning environments. To this end,
students may not record, reproduce, screenshot, photograph, or distribute any online content from
their courses, including recordings of in-person or Zoom class sessions, except for their own
personal educational use. Similarly, instructors may not, in general, share recordings of class
activities with individuals not already participating in the class as students, teachers, or guests.
Any recordings by students or instructors generally should be deleted at the end of the semester.
Failure to abide by recording policies may be an Honor Code violation or may result in corrective
action through the University’s accountability process depending on the circumstances.

## Honor Code and Academic Integrity

You are bound by all provisions of the Honor Code, found in the Vanderbilt Student Handbook and
available online at: http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/. Other
pertinent material may be found at the Honor Council’s website,
https://studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/honorcouncil/.
Specific considerations for this course include:
1. For individual assessments, the work should be your own. Absolutely no collaborations.
   For team-based work, the work should be collaboration between team members but no
   outside help from other team members. All team members must contribute equally
2. If you have questions or concerns about Honor Code issues in this class, please talk
   with me, your professor (Darren Pulsipher).

## Excellence by All

   It is my belief that everyone in this class can excel and that our collective learning experience is
   improved by including everyone fully. Toward that end, I commit to doing my best to use
   inclusive language and practices. If you observe actions in which I am not respectful or
   inclusive, please bring those to my attention ASAP.

## Mental Health & Wellness
   If you are experiencing undue personal and/or academic stress during the semester that may be
   interfering with your ability to perform academically, Vanderbilt’s Student Care Network offers a
   range of services to assist and support you. I am available to speak with you about stresses
   related to your work in my course, and I can assist you in connecting with the Student Care
   Network. The Office of Student Care Coordination
   (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/carecoordination/) is the central and first point of contact to help
   students navigate and connect to appropriate resources on and off-campus. The Student Care
   Network (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/studentcarenetwork/satellite-services/ ) also offers drop-in
   services on campus on a regular basis. If you or someone you know needs to speak with a
   professional counselor immediately, the University Counseling Center
   (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ucc/ ) offers Crisis Care Counseling.

## Disability Statement
   Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity for students with disabilities, as am I. If you need
   course accommodations due to a disability, please contact VU Student Access Services
   (https://www.vanderbilt.edu/student-access/disability/ ) to initiate that process.
   Emergency Evacuation Plan (for on-ground class)
   In the event of a fire or other emergency, the occupants of this class should collect coats and
   personal belongings and leave the building through the exits closest to the classroom and
   utilizing the stairs. VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY POLICY FORBIDS REENTRY TO A BUILDING
   IN WHICH AN ALARM HAS OCCURRED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION BY VANDERBILT
   SECURITY. If, in consequence of a disability, you anticipate the need for assistance, please
   discuss that need with the instructor/professor.

   For general guidelines, please visit: https://emergency.vanderbilt.edu/vu/quick-ref-
   guides/evacuation.php

   Please familiarize yourselves with the evacuation plans mentioned here for all the buildings in
   VUSE. http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/about/evacuationplans.php.
