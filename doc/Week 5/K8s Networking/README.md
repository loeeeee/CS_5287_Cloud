# Kubernetes Networking Primer

Kubernetes networking enables Pods to communicate with each other and external services, providing a unified,A
scalable, and secure network fabric across a cluster.

---

## Fundamental Model

1. **Flat Pod Network**
    - Every Pod receives a unique, routable IP address.
    - Pods communicate directly with no NAT (Container → Pod IP).

2. **Service Abstraction**
    - A Kubernetes Service defines a stable **ClusterIP** and DNS name.
    - Traffic to that IP routes to one of the matching Pods.

3. **NetworkPolicy**
    - Declarative rules controlling Pod-to-Pod traffic (namespaces, labels, ports).
    - Enforced by CNI plugin or eBPF layer (e.g., Calico, Cilium).

---

## Pod-to-Pod Connectivity

- **CNI Plugins** implement the network model:
    - **Calico**: BGP/routing
    - **Flannel**: VXLAN overlay
    - **Weave Net**: mesh overlay
    - **Cilium**: eBPF L3–L7 networking & security

- On each node:
    1. **CNI ADD**: create network namespace & veth pair
    2. Attach veth host end to bridge or overlay
    3. Assign Pod IP and routes

## Service Networking

- **ClusterIP**
    - Virtual IP accessible only inside cluster.
    - kube-proxy programs iptables/IPVS rules to load-balance traffic.

- **NodePort**
    - Opens a static port on every node for external access.

- **LoadBalancer**
    - In cloud environments, provisions an external load balancer with a public IP.

- **Ingress**
    - L7 routing rules (HTTP/S) managed by Ingress controller (NGINX, Traefik).

## DNS & Discovery

- **CoreDNS / kube-dns**
    - Pods and Services resolve names via in-cluster DNS (e.g., `my-service.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`).

- **Headless Services**
    - No ClusterIP; DNS returns Pod IPs directly for client-side load balancing.

---

## Network Policies

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-app-to-db
  namespace: prod
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels: { role: db }
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector: { role: app }
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
```


- Defines which Pods (by label) can talk to which Pods on which ports.
- When no policies exist, all Pod-to-Pod traffic is allowed by default.

---

## Multi-Cluster & Cross-Cloud

- **Service Mesh Federation** (Istio Multicluster)
- **Global DNS & Mesh** (Linkerd, Consul)
- **Network Fabric Extensions** (Submariner for direct pod networks)

---

## Best Practices

- Choose a CNI that matches your scale and security needs (e.g., Calico for policy, Flannel for simplicity).
- Always use NetworkPolicies to enforce least-privilege.
- Use headless Services for stateful sets and client-side balancing.
- Monitor network metrics (latency, throughput, dropped packets).
- Test MTU settings when using overlays (VXLAN adds 50 bytes).

# Summary

Kubernetes networking provides a unified IP-per-Pod model, stable service endpoints, and programmable security via NetworkPolicies. By selecting the right CNI plugin and leveraging Services, Ingress, and policies, you can build resilient and secure microservices architectures at scale.
