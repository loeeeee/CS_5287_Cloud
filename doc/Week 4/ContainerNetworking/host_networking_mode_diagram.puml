title Host Networking Mode

actor UserApp as Client

node "Host Machine" {
  interface "eth0\n(Host Interface)" as HostEth
  rectangle "Container\nNetwork Namespace" as Container {
    interface "eth0\n(shared with host)" as ContEth
  }
}

Client --> HostEth : send/receive traffic
HostEth <-- ContEth : same namespace, no NAT

note right of HostEth
  • Container shares host’s network namespace  
  • Uses host’s IP and interfaces directly  
  • No port mapping needed  
  • High performance, low isolation
