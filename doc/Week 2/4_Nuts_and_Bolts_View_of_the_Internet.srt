1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,385
All right.

2
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:04,652
Quickly, we're going to talk about, 
the nuts and bolts of the internet.

3
00:00:04,949 --> 00:00:07,952
This is going to be a acronym soup.

4
00:00:08,084 --> 00:00:11,582
Today, because, we got to understand

5
00:00:11,582 --> 00:00:14,849
a little bit of the, networks
and the internet architecture.

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,545
To understand distributed systems,
especially in cloud.

7
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:22,010
After all, clouds are all networked
together, how we interact with them.

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,970
So it might it's not might
it is important that we understand,

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,633
kind of, the verbiage,
the words that are used

10
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,801
when we talk about internet
and how it came about.

11
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:37,223
And, and remember,
the internet's all about communicating

12
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:41,348
it across, a network of machines
that can be all over the world.

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,572
So this when you think about it, it's
pretty darn cool when you think about,

14
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:49,565
the internet right
there, using machines all over the world.

15
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:52,931
So let's talk about some of the background
and where it came from.

16
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:55,505
What is the internet?

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,409
It's not a bunch of tubes.

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:01,445
No, as someone famous said,

19
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:04,646
no, it's
a network of interconnected devices

20
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:09,563
which can be your PC servers,
mobile devices,

21
00:01:09,992 --> 00:01:14,876
all running applications and services,
all sharing information between each other

22
00:01:15,173 --> 00:01:17,681
through, connected infrastructure

23
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,595
and understanding
all that connected infrastructure.

24
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:22,598
That's what we're going to talk about
in the next couple lectures, right?

25
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:25,040
So first off, communication links.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,363
How are things connected
that physical media.

27
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,290
There's lots of different ways fiber
I wish I had fiber in my house.

28
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,445
That would be so cool.

29
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:39,065
Copper is probably the most, prevalent.

30
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,266
And well, at least in, in some countries.

31
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:45,434
Believe it or not, most pavilion over
the world is radio waves.

32
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,635
Wow. Radio waves. Right.

33
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:49,460
And satellites.

34
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,387
We're starting to see a big amount
of satellite usage for internet,

35
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,918
but they're all characterized
by something called bandwidth.

36
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:02,132
Bandwidth is how much data can I push
through every second?

37
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,607
That's your data transmission rate.

38
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:07,115
That's your bandwidth, right?

39
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:09,392
I want as much bandwidth as I can get.

40
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:09,656
Right.

41
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:13,055
Because I can move data in and out faster

42
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,685
in between my machine and another machine
somewhere else in the world.

43
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,965
What connects all these, together
are network switches and routers.

44
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:23,252
So we're going to talk a little bit

45
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,958
about the difference between these
and what they do

46
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,674
and how they connect to each other.

47
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:30,611
But the idea is this
is that these networks, which is in

48
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:34,670
routers, they forward packets
between connected devices.

49
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,026
So if I say, hey,
I want some information from

50
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:42,755
my cloud instance
that's running in, India,

51
00:02:44,306 --> 00:02:48,398
I've got I send out a request to 
my router.

52
00:02:48,398 --> 00:02:50,774
Here it goes. Oh, you're asking for this?

53
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:54,503
I know another router
that knows how to get access to that.

54
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:58,760
So it sends that information
out to that router.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,334
That router goes I gotcha.

56
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,875
It sends it to another router
which sends it

57
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,845
to a computer somewhere else.

58
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:12,422
And that gives me the information,
then sends it back to set of routers.

59
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,831
Could be the same routers
or different routers.

60
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,811
Back to to to give me the information.

61
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,461
It's really incredible.

62
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,860
Oh, it's amazingly incredible
right how this all works.

63
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,193
But that enables data flow
between different

64
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:28,196
computers and different devices out there.

65
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,374
There's something called internet service
providers.

66
00:03:30,374 --> 00:03:31,397
These are the people that are

67
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:34,400
providing the internet
to individuals and businesses.

68
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:39,086
When, the internet first kicked off,
it wasn't it was Arpanet.

69
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:42,650
When it first kicked off, there weren't
any internet service providers.

70
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:44,960
There were network providers. Right.

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,656
And these,
these big, government and financial,

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,385
government
and academia institutions connected their

73
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:56,708
networks
together, connected their machines

74
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:01,196
together across long distances,
which, started this whole thing.

75
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:04,463
And now, it's pervasive. It's everywhere.

76
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:06,245
You can get the internet.

77
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,555
I've been traveling a lot lately,

78
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:10,832
and I can get the internet anywhere,
even on the airplane.

79
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:13,637
I can get the the internet,
which is, really incredible.

80
00:04:15,815 --> 00:04:17,564
Okay, think of the internet

81
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:21,755
as as it's grown up,
as a network of networks,

82
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,484
it's interconnected internet service
providers and institutions.

83
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:26,540
Right.

84
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,599
In order to make this work,
we had to have some standardization

85
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,635
or protocols
for sending and receiving messages.

86
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:39,773
Some of these you may recognize TCP,
IP, http.

87
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,974
Skype was a protocol around 211.

88
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,218
These are all different standards.

89
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,221
You should look them
up, learn more about them.

90
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,498
Internet standards that are out.
Those are protocols.

91
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,917
Internet standards that are out

92
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,910
there come primarily
through two major organizations.

93
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,926
To RFC request for comments on the IETF,

94
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:03,863
which is the Internet Engineering Task
Force.

95
00:05:03,863 --> 00:05:05,183
It's been around a long time.

96
00:05:05,183 --> 00:05:09,605
They come up with many of the internet, 
standards that are out there today.

97
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:13,169
Here are some other, I said acronym soup.

98
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:13,664
Here you go.

99
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:17,195
Here's some acronym soup for you,
domain Name service DNS.

100
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,231
This is as you notice,

101
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:23,234
humans like names, computers like numbers.

102
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,369
DNS is a name to number mapping.

103
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,823
So if I want to go to google.com,
which I know is 8.8.8.8,

104
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,037
look, I'm a, domain name, so, service
Tony if I'm on that,

105
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:40,987
because I knew that
google.com maps to 8.8.8.

106
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,957
So that's

107
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:46,960
an IP address and internet
protocol address.

108
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:47,620
Right.

109
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,976
Which is IP stands for not intellectual
property by Internet Protocol.

110
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:56,695
And then Http Hypertext Transfer
Protocol,

111
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,777
SNMp, SMTp,
which is a mail transfer protocol.

112
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:02,437
Simple.

113
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:06,298
And then FTP has been around a long time
feel file transfer protocol.

114
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,598
So anything that ends in TP,

115
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:12,568
you're going to be it's
probably transfer protocol something.

116
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:13,327
Right.

117
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,835
So keep that in mind
when you're talking about the internet.
