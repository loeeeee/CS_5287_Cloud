1
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:01,715
All right.

2
00:00:01,715 --> 00:00:02,375
Let's talk about a

3
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,038
layered approach to the internet
and how how it works, how it works.

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,008
Let's go back to the Postal Service.

5
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,097
We talked about it before.

6
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:14,684
If I want to send a letter or a package
from my house to my parents house,

7
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,545
there's certain things
that I need to put on that package

8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:21,515
in order for it to get to the destination.

9
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:21,779
Right.

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,838
And that's the whole idea,
is that if I have a standard way

11
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:29,864
of doing that,
I can address an envelope that it goes in.

12
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,900
The message is inside the envelope
or inside the box,

13
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:36,167
that it's a standard size, that it's

14
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:41,579
that I don't just hand over, 
a handful of stuff to the postal worker

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,437
and say, hey, deliver

16
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:47,057
this to, you know, my parents,
if I can be crazy, if you do that.

17
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:50,390
So there are some common
things that we need to do,

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,743
in order to make this work.

19
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:56,462
So we use a layered approach where
I can talk about, how all this stuff

20
00:00:56,462 --> 00:01:01,742
fits together, and we need to organize it
so that, we can at least,

21
00:01:01,907 --> 00:01:07,187
get packets from point
A, host A to host B and back.

22
00:01:07,814 --> 00:01:10,487
So let's talk
let's talk about the different layers.

23
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,589
So there's, there's lots of different
people are going to go there.

24
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:16,262
And there are seven layers to the IP
stack. Yes.

25
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,067
Theoretical layers. Let's talk about that.

26
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,037
Let's talk about what's what's real
and happening out there together.

27
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:26,525
There's really four with the fifth
one that I call physical bits on the wire.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,749
All right
I'm physically moving bits at the wire.

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,861
But let's start at the top of the stack.

30
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,841
The top of the stack
is the application layer.

31
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:38,108
So here I'm
supporting network applications.

32
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:43,421
So here are my transfer protocols
FTP, SMTp, Http.

33
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:45,236
Those are those are those.

34
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:48,239
That means there's a common envelope.

35
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:54,212
As my envelope there's a common
set of packages that are out there.

36
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:58,535
That I'm going to put my, information in.

37
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:01,967
So there's your envelope,
there's the transport.

38
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:05,564
How is it going to get there,
whether it's TCP or UDP.

39
00:02:05,564 --> 00:02:10,844
Those are the big, data
transfer protocols, that are out there.

40
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,055
That's process to process protocol.

41
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:18,599
This would be, analogous to, what's the

42
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:22,922
oh that everything
is going to, go in a,

43
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:27,806
Postal service, track.

44
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:28,499
There you go.

45
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:29,291
That's how I'm transferring

46
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:32,294
information in that Postal Service truck
or on an airplane.

47
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:35,396
There's common ways of getting
the information from point A to point B

48
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,805
network IP routing.

49
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:43,844
This is, 
how I'm, getting from point A to point B.

50
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,385
This would be addresses.

51
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,431
Right. So a street address.

52
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,599
And if you look, it's,

53
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,087
a number on your street,
your street name, your city,

54
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,618
your providence for state, your country.

55
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,367
We have the same things.

56
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,875
We are in network protocols.

57
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:08,594
There's I IPv4 and IPv6,

58
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:12,455
one that has,
we started running out of addresses.

59
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:13,577
Those are those four numbers.

60
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,415
8.8.8 for Google, you know.

61
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:22,355
128 101 87 I can I still remember
I still remember my old,

62
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:26,975
IP addresses for when I was in college,
like, last millennium.

63
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:28,295
It's amazing. Right?

64
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,826
But those

65
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:35,225
addresses there are,
is that network routing diagrams, right.

66
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:38,690
That tells me where it is. Right?

67
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,693
It tells me, which general area

68
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:46,082
and then, more specific, more specific
to how you get to the last number.

69
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:51,296
The,
the new IP, versions give us trillions

70
00:03:51,296 --> 00:03:54,167
quadrillion, different addresses.

71
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:57,005
We ran out of the,
the old the old way of doing it,

72
00:03:57,005 --> 00:04:01,163
which was for, for a bit numbers.

73
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:03,506
Now it's it's much larger than that.

74
00:04:03,506 --> 00:04:05,189
So we're in good shape.

75
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:08,621
Then the next one is the data transfer
between neighboring networks.

76
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,370
What?

77
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,274
How am I, connected together?

78
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:13,835
Right.

79
00:04:13,835 --> 00:04:18,389
Between the different networks,
that would be Ethernet 802

80
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:21,986
11, which is Wi-Fi, PGP
and things like that.

81
00:04:22,316 --> 00:04:23,966
And that's that's really it.

82
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:28,751
So because these are standardized,
I have an easy way

83
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,546
that I can move data from one host
to another across multiple networks,

84
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:34,592
and that that

85
00:04:34,592 --> 00:04:37,595
routing number in the network
is, is highly critical,

86
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:41,126
because that's how I know where to start
routing things.

87
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:45,845
I could say, hey, I'm on the 128,
network.

88
00:04:45,845 --> 00:04:48,914
Oh, I, I got 128 over here.
Send that to me.

89
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,851
And then it it boils down that way.

90
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,458
It's actually pretty cool.

91
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:54,689
All right.

92
00:04:54,689 --> 00:05:00,002
There's some cloud protocols
that are all based on Http or Https.

93
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,784
Web protocols.

94
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:06,338
That's how most of the cloud APIs
are built on, including our Rest interface

95
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:11,255
that we've talked about in
previous lectures and new protocols like,

96
00:05:11,288 --> 00:05:16,106
MCP model context protocol
that we're seeing happen with a genetic

97
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,914
I they're all still built
on top of a RESTful, interface,

98
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:26,006
which is built on top of Http,
which is the application layer.
