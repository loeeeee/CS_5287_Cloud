1
00:00:01,385 --> 00:00:03,629
All right, let's talk about internet
architecture.

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,751
We talk about nuts and bolts.

3
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:08,777
In a previous, lecture,
just kind of acronym soup.

4
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:11,747
Let's talk
about the actual architecture now.

5
00:00:11,747 --> 00:00:14,651
So first off, let's take, a view

6
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:17,654
of the internet from a service view.

7
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:18,743
All right.

8
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,977
What does the internet really provide
for me?

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,891
What services?

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,719
Does it provide for me as an individual
and also to applications?

11
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,293
Well, provides a lot, right?

12
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:35,144
It provides, 
the world Wide Web, voice over IP, email,

13
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:39,533
games, e-commerce, social networks,
the list goes on and on,

14
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:43,691
especially for an application where maybe
I want to tap into all that information.

15
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:48,080
It provides an, programable,

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,149
interface to all those applications
that are out there.

17
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:55,373
So it's not just the network
and the physical stuff.

18
00:00:55,373 --> 00:00:59,564
There's also, the concept
and we talked about the rest interface

19
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:01,049
in previous lectures.

20
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,052
There's also this concept of providing
an API,

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,682
and ways that I can connect

22
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:10,982
to the internet and the services
on the internet that are out there.

23
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:13,985
It's very analogous to the Postal Service,

24
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:17,615
in that I don't know how my mail gets from

25
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:21,608
one place to another, or a message
gets from one place to another.

26
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,961
I just know that it happens.

27
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:24,314
All right.

28
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,525
So it's becomes ubiquitous.

29
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:30,353
It's pretty prevailing everywhere
and easy to use for anyone.

30
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:31,871
All right.

31
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:35,270
So let's take a closer look
at the network structure a little bit.

32
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:40,286
We can break the network, down
into, three major groups,

33
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:44,147
the network edge,
which most of you are dealing in the edge.

34
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:49,328
These are host machines and client servers
and in data centers, things like that.

35
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:51,374
That's what they call the network edge.

36
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:55,367
At my house,
it can be a whole bunch of smart, devices

37
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:57,611
that I have,
like the lock on my front door

38
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:01,703
or the lights in the house
or cameras, all that stuff.

39
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:04,706
That's that network edge
all connected to the internet.

40
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,468
That's the extreme, dynamic
or the extreme edge out there.

41
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:11,405
There's some dynamic edge,
which could be your cell phone.

42
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:14,243
You're moving around
connecting to different networks

43
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:16,421
dynamically all the time.

44
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,566
Kind of crazy
when you think about it. Right.

45
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:20,183
Then there's access networks.

46
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,064
This is physical media.

47
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:24,704
These are wireless communications

48
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:27,740
and wired communications
separate from the network edge.

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,294
Because, as I mentioned, my cell phone
can connect to a tower in California

50
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:35,330
where I live, or in Saudi Arabia
where I just was.

51
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,541
My device is the same,

52
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:42,095
but it's connecting to different access
networks, throughout.

53
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,372
So that's
how I'm connecting into the internet.

54
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,705
And then the network core
is the interconnected routers

55
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:50,906
that make up this network of networks
that are out there.

56
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,526
Access networks and,

57
00:02:55,526 --> 00:02:59,387
how do I connect to systems
through an edge router?

58
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,697
That's that's, critical.

59
00:03:01,697 --> 00:03:01,961
Right.

60
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:07,208
If I'm at home, I could have, a Wi-Fi.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,673
That's that's, access

62
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:13,709
to a physical to the internet,
through my Wi-Fi.

63
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:17,042
Institutional access could be, plugging

64
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:20,045
in at work or at school.

65
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:23,081
And then also when I'm out and about,

66
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,985
just connecting to a mobile network

67
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:31,067
now connects me through maybe, 5G
or, LTE.

68
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,981
Heaven forbid it's still LTE for you.

69
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,182
It's a little bit slower
because of bandwidth, right?

70
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,855
I want as much bandwidth
as I possibly can,

71
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:42,023
which are the bits
per second of access to a network.

72
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,026
And, do I have a dedicated line

73
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:48,029
or, physical or shared line?

74
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:51,989
At my house, I have both a dedicated line
and a shared line.

75
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:53,342
Shared line.

76
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:57,566
I get more bandwidth, but I'm sharing it
with a bunch of other people

77
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:59,183
right in my neighborhood.

78
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:01,295
My dedicated line.

79
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:04,067
I'm guaranteed a certain amount
of bandwidth because I'm on the only.

80
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,156
I'm the only one on that one.

81
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:08,390
But it's not as much bandwidth,
but it's more reliable.

82
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:13,340
So there's lots of there's lots to go
on in in this internet thing.

83
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,155
All right.

84
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,168
Let's talk about the network core.

85
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:17,828
Right.

86
00:04:17,828 --> 00:04:21,029
This is a mess of interconnected routers.

87
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:26,012
And the idea here
is that these routers know

88
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:30,335
where to direct packets,
a packet, it's just like, Postal service.

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:35,285
I've got a package that I'm sending
from my house to maybe my parents house.

90
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:36,605
Right.

91
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:39,905
How many post offices doesn't
need to go through to get there?

92
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,634
That's the same sort of thing
with the network core.

93
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,637
Each router can be considered
a post office.

94
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:51,521
And, 
there's a little a number attached to,

95
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,986
where you're trying to get to
or send the package to.

96
00:04:55,316 --> 00:05:00,431
And, these, routers know where to send it
because I don't know how to handle this.

97
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,622
I'm going to send it to my pal over here
because I think he knows how to handle it.

98
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:07,031
And then maybe he
he knows how to handle it.

99
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,935
And he he goes
on. Now, remember, it's a hierarchy.

100
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,542
So it's it's going to, hit

101
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,875
probably more than two routers
when you're routing across the world.

102
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:21,089
But each packet is transmitted,
at a four link capacity.

103
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:26,897
It's going to try and forward that package
or that packet to the next router

104
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:30,889
until it finds the right router
that it belongs to.

105
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,321
And then once it hits that post office,
it will deliver it to the network

106
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:38,083
edge, to the device that says, hey, here
I am.

107
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:39,238
Right.

108
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,680
And so that's the
idea behind the network core.

109
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,772
The idea that it's a

110
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:48,775
network of networks is really important.

111
00:05:48,874 --> 00:05:52,306
Because these are all independent
networks,

112
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:56,992
which is really crazy that we've been able
to do, create something.

113
00:05:56,992 --> 00:06:00,787
So, attached

114
00:06:00,787 --> 00:06:04,054
and so, I what's your right word?

115
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:08,014
This, this world that we have
with all these political beliefs

116
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,334
and all these different things

117
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:12,337
that we can connect a bunch of routers
together and we can all agree

118
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:16,099
that, hey, we're going to move things,
move things along.

119
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:16,990
Right?

120
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,323
So these internet service providers,
they're all connected together.

121
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:23,491
Residential company universities

122
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:26,527
are all they're all connected
in this network of networks.

123
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,071
Like I mentioned before, these packets
are being routed between these routers,

124
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:36,757
which are owned by lots of different,
companies, which is amazing as well.

125
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:40,354
And, it's, it's resulted

126
00:06:40,354 --> 00:06:43,357
in, a vast, complex network

127
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:46,657
that, sometimes gets, sensor.

128
00:06:47,218 --> 00:06:49,759
I don't want all packets
coming into my country.

129
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,211
Someone might say,

130
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:55,699
but overall it's it's really incredible
that we've been able to do this.

131
00:06:57,943 --> 00:06:58,339
All right.

132
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:02,233
Let's take a look at a couple pictures
on how this how this really works.

133
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:03,091
Right.

134
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,698
It would be interesting

135
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:08,932
if there was a global internet
service provider.

136
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:13,750
But, the ramifications of that,
as I've already said,

137
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,334
would be really, really hard, right?

138
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,063
Because who's going to control
the whole internet and who wants someone

139
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,977
to have that much control? Instead?

140
00:07:20,977 --> 00:07:24,442
It's a federation
of a bunch of regional networks

141
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:29,722
or a network of network, system
where I'm I'm sharing.

142
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,867
Hey, I've got routing information here.

143
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,210
I'll take your packets type of thing.

144
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:37,939
This still gives governments
the ability to monitor

145
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:43,285
and, censor the information
coming into their countries, people,

146
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:47,839
that are all about
freedom of of information don't like that.

147
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:50,347
But without that capability,

148
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:53,350
I don't think the internet
would have spread as quickly as it has.

149
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:57,970
And we're seeing more and more,
techniques

150
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:02,689
to share information across,
this vast internet that we have.

151
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,207
It's still amazing that it exists.

152
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:06,418
Right.

153
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,685
I'm sitting
on top of this network of networks.

154
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:12,721
We're seeing things like content provider
networks.

155
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:16,813
This is where I'm providing actual content
across the network.

156
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,255
Google, Microsoft.

157
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:20,377
Akamai.

158
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,324
Tencent.

159
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:25,327
These are these are big content providers,

160
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:28,528
that are providing information
across this whole network.

161
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,191
And it's it's really amazing
that they can all work together

162
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:35,953
in this, kind of weird.

163
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,451
It's but,
you know, maybe someone should sit back

164
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:43,807
and do a poli sci,
a dissertation on the growth of,

165
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:46,810
the internet,
because it's really, truly amazing.

166
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,846
How much information is being shared
across the world?

167
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:53,773
In this, technical, technically,

168
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:59,152
very viable, politically amazing
that had happened type of,
