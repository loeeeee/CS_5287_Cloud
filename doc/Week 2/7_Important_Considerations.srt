1
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:03,761
Okay, I want to talk about some things

2
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:05,642
to consider
when you're working in the cloud.

3
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:07,754
In some respects.

4
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:12,275
The cloud is like,
CPU in some respects, right?

5
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,344
I've got my processor,
which could be my host,

6
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:18,743
and I've got data
that's spread all over the place.

7
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:23,264
And just like a CPU where maybe
I don't have the data readily available,

8
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:26,597
and it has to do page faults and handle
page swapping and all that.

9
00:00:27,554 --> 00:00:30,491
I've got even a bigger problem
when I talk about internet,

10
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:33,923
when I send out a request,
when I send a packet,

11
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:37,190
how do I know it
actually arrived on the other end?

12
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:41,645
This could be a problem where when I'm
requesting data, I send it back out.

13
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,328
I'm expecting a response back.

14
00:00:43,328 --> 00:00:46,463
I need to handle this
appropriately. Right.

15
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,806
So and then also I need to look at that.

16
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:51,809
My internet may be my bottleneck
especially.

17
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:54,746
It's much slower
going over the internet than going

18
00:00:54,746 --> 00:00:59,267
just on the IO
bus inside my, my computer itself.

19
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:03,095
So packets if I send a lot of packets out.

20
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:03,623
Right.

21
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:08,111
They get queued and they get, sent out

22
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,972
and then routers
can some time buffer information as well.

23
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,470
And can I rely on that router

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,397
that I've sent the stuff
to, to, not lose my data.

25
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:21,344
And sometimes they do.

26
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:24,347
And sometimes there's slowness
because that router's overwhelmed.

27
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:27,779
And there could be, packet delay.

28
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:30,782
So that's why some of this happens, right?

29
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:32,927
These routers are processing
a lot of packets.

30
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:33,818
It's saying, hey.

31
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:36,755
Oh, this guy wants this, information.

32
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,636
I know it's on router number five.

33
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:41,012
I'll send it over there.

34
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:43,355
But if that router is getting, you know,

35
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:46,358
millions and billions of packets.

36
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,054
A minute,
how how is it going to handle that?

37
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:50,351
Right?

38
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:55,202
So it keeps them up,
it buffers them and and keeps going along.

39
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,941
Sometimes they have
about highly redundant systems in there.

40
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:01,043
But these these routers are fine

41
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:04,475
tuned to do network, network routing.

42
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:05,795
Right.

43
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:10,943
But they still you can still lose data
and you can still have delays.

44
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:14,243
All right.

45
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:16,850
Reason, other reasons for losses
and delays.

46
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,952
The best way to think of it is,

47
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,021
is, this concept here,

48
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:26,024
I've got nodal
processing is what it's called.

49
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:28,928
Nodal processing includes,

50
00:02:28,928 --> 00:02:32,657
d proc Dhcp trans and d prop.

51
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:36,419
So that that's the propagation
is the last one.

52
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:38,993
The d proc is nodal processing.

53
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,161
How much time does it take,

54
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:46,781
for the processor
on that router to check er bits,

55
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:50,510
determine the output link and then it

56
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,688
that that's what it does.

57
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:54,470
It's typically pretty quick.

58
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,374
But like I said before,

59
00:02:57,374 --> 00:03:00,278
if I run into issues I get d q right.

60
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:03,446
If, I get dq'd
that's like a swimming term,

61
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:08,495
I get, I get stuck in the queue,
which means I'm waiting for the output

62
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:12,455
link, for transmission and depends
on how much congestion there is.

63
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,412
Right.

64
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:17,603
And then, d trans
is how long does it take to transmit.

65
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:19,979
And then propagation.

66
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,081
Propagation is probably the longest
but it could be queuing.

67
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,622
It could be queue time.

68
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,625
Especially if I'm overwhelmed.

69
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:30,539
All right.

70
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,486
So how is this relayed to the cloud?

71
00:03:32,486 --> 00:03:37,766
Just remember, when you're working in a
in a cloud, especially in public clouds.

72
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:42,485
You've got a lot of other,

73
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,333
tenants that are running
on the same machine

74
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,303
and on the same network
hitting the same router,

75
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:49,811
which means you have the concept of noisy

76
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:52,814
neighbor, which we've talked about
in previous lectures.

77
00:03:52,814 --> 00:03:55,850
Noisy neighbor means I've got someone else
that's they're running

78
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,348
similar things or running different things
doesn't matter.

79
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:02,351
But it's hitting
the router could be slowing things down.

80
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:05,882
And if the router becomes overwhelmed,
it can lose packets.

81
00:04:06,377 --> 00:04:09,050
Ideally they don't, but

82
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,317
we're talking billions
and billions of packets a day.

83
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,132
It's kind of lose some of them.

84
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:18,224
So you have to make sure
when you are, working with cloud services

85
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:21,854
that you have retry
and that you have some kind of guarantees

86
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,296
that the other side
got what you expected them to get.
