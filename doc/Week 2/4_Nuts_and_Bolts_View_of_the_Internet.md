  # Nuts and Bolts View of the Internet

---

## Why Understand Networks and the Internet Architecture?

- Distributed systems such as the cloud are, after all, networked systems.
- The communicating entities are geographically distributed over possibly heterogeneous networks.
- The location of the communicating entities, the underlying network architecture and protocols used, and the span of the distributed system will have substantial impact on the performance and reliability of the distributed system.
- Thus, some background on networking is important.

## What's the Internet?

- Network of interconnected computing devices
    - End systems/hosts (PCs, servers, mobile devices)
    - Running applications and services
    - Connected through communication infrastructure
- Core Infrastructure Components
    - Communication Links
        - Physical media: fiber optic, copper wire, radio waves, satellites
        - Characterized by bandwidth (data transmission rate)
    - Network Switches & Routers
        - Forward data packets between connected devices
        - Enable data flow across the network
    - Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
        - Connect end users to the broader internet
        - Form hierarchical network structure

## What's the Internet: (cont)

- Internet: "network of Networks"
  - Interconnected ISPs( Internet Service Providers)
- Protocols control sending, receiving of messages
    - For example, TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, 802.11
- Internet standards
    - RFC: request for comments
    - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force 
- Gloabl Naming Convention
    - Domain Name System (DNS)
    - Internet Protocol (IP)
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
