00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:04,685
<font color=#043E79FF>In this lecture we're going to talk about</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>cloud computing,</font>

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:07,985
<font color=#043E79FF>its history, its motivations,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and why we have it today.</font>

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,516
<font color=#043E79FF>So motivating scenario.</font>

4
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,575
<font color=#043E79FF>First off, the internet in the 1990s</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>was just blossoming.</font>

5
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:19,964
<font color=#043E79FF>There's a big.com boom at the time</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and how small businesses</font>

6
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:23,231
<font color=#043E79FF>wanted to use the new internet</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and things like that.</font>

7
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:26,696
<font color=#043E79FF>And but these services</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>needed computing power</font>

8
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:30,326
<font color=#043E79FF>and they network and storage</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and all these things a lot.</font>

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,385
<font color=#043E79FF>There were a lot of incubators</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that started at that time, really fast</font>

10
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:38,048
<font color=#043E79FF>anywhere</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>because I had a startup in the 1990s and,</font>

11
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:43,130
<font color=#043E79FF>I got some incubation funds</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and they gave me servers that I could use.</font>

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,384
<font color=#043E79FF>That was awesome.</font>

13
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:46,859
<font color=#043E79FF>I could host my website there.</font>

14
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,334
<font color=#043E79FF>And that was to like an IBM incubator,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>if I remember.</font>

15
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:50,357
<font color=#043E79FF>Right.</font>

16
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:52,073
<font color=#043E79FF>And there were a lot of these going on,</font>

17
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,604
<font color=#043E79FF>but the capital expenditure</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>was pretty high.</font>

18
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:58,079
<font color=#043E79FF>Right. And then someone</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>had to manage those servers.</font>

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,742
<font color=#043E79FF>So it cost us money to hire</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>someone to manage those servers.</font>

20
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,811
<font color=#043E79FF>And so there was a lot of short term risk</font>

21
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,814
<font color=#043E79FF>and capital risks</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that you had to invest upfront.</font>

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,576
<font color=#043E79FF>And that's why you had a lot of companies</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>in the early 90s during the.com boom,</font>

23
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:15,008
<font color=#043E79FF>that were investing in infrastructure.</font>

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,615
<font color=#043E79FF>And a lot of infrastructure companies</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>came out of that.</font>

25
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:22,961
<font color=#043E79FF>And but at the same time, I just bought,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>you know, maybe I buy a $50,000 server.</font>

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,073
<font color=#043E79FF>I'm not using it all the time.</font>

27
00:01:25,073 --> 00:01:29,330
<font color=#043E79FF>So that's a wasted operational resource</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>right there on my wall.</font>

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,485
<font color=#043E79FF>That kind of stinks. Right?</font>

29
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:34,379
<font color=#043E79FF>So in the 90s, we started seeing,</font>

30
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,547
<font color=#043E79FF>some interesting things</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>bubble up around cloud computing.</font>

31
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,022
<font color=#043E79FF>So the desired</font>

32
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:43,124
<font color=#043E79FF>solution that people wanted</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>was that entrepreneurs</font>

33
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:47,348
<font color=#043E79FF>and small businesses</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>could use and lease resources.</font>

34
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,384
<font color=#043E79FF>That was that incubation,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>kind of thing that was going on.</font>

35
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:53,915
<font color=#043E79FF>They could, lease resources and use those,</font>

36
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:58,205
<font color=#043E79FF>as they needed</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>instead of worrying about, buying them</font>

37
00:01:58,205 --> 00:02:02,000
<font color=#043E79FF>and maintaining them, they could focus on</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>what was important for them,</font>

38
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:06,587
<font color=#043E79FF>which is which is important</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>as a small business focus is everything.</font>

39
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,590
<font color=#043E79FF>And so that was that was key at the time.</font>

40
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,560
<font color=#043E79FF>Also.</font>

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,959
<font color=#043E79FF>It would be great</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>if your physical devices weren't</font>

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,325
<font color=#043E79FF>physically located with you,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>because then you could do</font>

43
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:22,493
<font color=#043E79FF>a true internet company</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>where you could reside anywhere.</font>

44
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:25,595
<font color=#043E79FF>You didn't have to physically</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>touch your servers and things like that.</font>

45
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:28,565
<font color=#043E79FF>So that was another desire as,</font>

46
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:31,403
<font color=#043E79FF>as people were starting to, to,</font>

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,825
<font color=#043E79FF>grow in that 90s, early 2000 things.</font>

48
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:39,620
<font color=#043E79FF>So all these desired solutions,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>all the pent up pressure there</font>

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,164
<font color=#043E79FF>kind of drove more and more of,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>the adoption of cloud technology.</font>

50
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:46,715
<font color=#043E79FF>So were out there.</font>

51
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:50,972
<font color=#043E79FF>So here's some key properties</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>from a Berkeley paper, that's out there,</font>

52
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:53,843
<font color=#043E79FF>on cloud computing.</font>

53
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:56,813
<font color=#043E79FF>I needed something that, and I was</font>

54
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,849
<font color=#043E79FF>I was involved in the global grid form</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>at the time,</font>

55
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:04,040
<font color=#043E79FF>global grid form</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>was all about high performance computing</font>

56
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,604
<font color=#043E79FF>and created some of the largest,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>high performance computing,</font>

57
00:03:08,627 --> 00:03:12,323
<font color=#043E79FF>clusters in the world</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>with well over a million nodes.</font>

58
00:03:12,323 --> 00:03:15,425
<font color=#043E79FF>Some of you may have even participated</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>in setting at home.</font>

59
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:19,649
<font color=#043E79FF>The whole concept was, is,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>let's take all these idle compute cycles</font>

60
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,883
<font color=#043E79FF>that are sitting out there,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and let's use them for something,</font>

61
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:27,404
<font color=#043E79FF>sitting at home was,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>search for extraterrestrial life.</font>

62
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:31,859
<font color=#043E79FF>And, and I'm sure everyone had that</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>little,</font>

63
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:35,753
<font color=#043E79FF>screensaver up that was crunching numbers</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>all across the world.</font>

64
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,789
<font color=#043E79FF>That same concept kind of,</font>

65
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,904
<font color=#043E79FF>let itself into cloud computing</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>from the 90s of sharing resources</font>

66
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:48,326
<font color=#043E79FF>for high performance</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>computing across millions of nodes to now.</font>

67
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,494
<font color=#043E79FF>Hey, what about enterprise</font>

68
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:54,695
<font color=#043E79FF>organizations that had a lot of capacity,</font>

69
00:03:55,124 --> 00:04:00,305
<font color=#043E79FF>but they had burst of of, of need.</font>

70
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,209
<font color=#043E79FF>Great.</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>The best example of this is Amazon, right?</font>

71
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,730
<font color=#043E79FF>Amazon was growing,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>but most of their transactions</font>

72
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,733
<font color=#043E79FF>were happening in November and December.</font>

73
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,264
<font color=#043E79FF>So what do you do with all those</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>spare cycles the rest of the year.</font>

74
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:17,828
<font color=#043E79FF>So that those are the sorts of things</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that, started happening?</font>

75
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,214
<font color=#043E79FF>All right.</font>

76
00:04:19,214 --> 00:04:24,065
<font color=#043E79FF>So, another thing that happened,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>during the 90s and early 2000</font>

77
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,563
<font color=#043E79FF>was, the browser and the whole concept</font>

78
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:30,566
<font color=#043E79FF>of the thin client and the web</font>

79
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:34,922
<font color=#043E79FF>really started to, to bubble up,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>which was, which was very, very important.</font>

80
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,011
<font color=#043E79FF>Right?</font>

81
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:40,301
<font color=#043E79FF>What it meant that,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I didn't have to have a big beefy box</font>

82
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,502
<font color=#043E79FF>at home or on my desk at work.</font>

83
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:47,363
<font color=#043E79FF>Instead,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I use more of a browser or thin client,</font>

84
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:51,125
<font color=#043E79FF>and I access big servers on the back end</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that did all the hard work.</font>

85
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:54,491
<font color=#043E79FF>Well, this lends itself well to to cloud.</font>

86
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:55,811
<font color=#043E79FF>Technology too.</font>

87
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:59,441
<font color=#043E79FF>So these are all really interesting,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>concepts</font>

88
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,906
<font color=#043E79FF>that kind of contributed</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>to the adoption of cloud.</font>

89
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:03,896
<font color=#043E79FF>All right.</font>

90
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:07,889
<font color=#043E79FF>So let's take a look</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>at the newest definition of cloud.</font>

91
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,727
<font color=#043E79FF>Because if we want to really look at,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>cloud.</font>

92
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,885
<font color=#043E79FF>And I remember when this, when, cloud</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>computing was first coined</font>

93
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:20,528
<font color=#043E79FF>back in the early 2000,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I remember I was sitting in Edinburgh</font>

94
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,874
<font color=#043E79FF>at a open grid forum</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>or Global Grid Forum conference, and,</font>

95
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:27,557
<font color=#043E79FF>a guy</font>

96
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:30,691
<font color=#043E79FF>from, Amazon said,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>hey, we're going to take some of the stuff</font>

97
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:34,453
<font color=#043E79FF>we've been talking about</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and using and high performance computing.</font>

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,700
<font color=#043E79FF>And, I'm going to try and do that</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>on our infrastructure</font>

99
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:44,287
<font color=#043E79FF>in, at Amazon because, hey,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I got all these spare cycles, and I said,</font>

100
00:05:44,551 --> 00:05:47,356
<font color=#043E79FF>I'll use some of those spare cycles</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>any time.</font>

101
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:50,887
<font color=#043E79FF>And, they, they came up with this</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>really cool concept of cloud</font>

102
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:54,814
<font color=#043E79FF>computing different than grid computing,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>which is what we were doing.</font>

103
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,378
<font color=#043E79FF>The whole concept of grid computing</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>was like it was a utility.</font>

104
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:02,569
<font color=#043E79FF>So he upped the game to cloud computing,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>which was really interesting.</font>

105
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:07,420
<font color=#043E79FF>But if we look at the definition of cloud</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>computing, the key things you want to,</font>

106
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,555
<font color=#043E79FF>see here is that cloud computing is this</font>

107
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:13,558
<font color=#043E79FF>model that, lets me,</font>

108
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,627
<font color=#043E79FF>ubiquitously</font>

109
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,894
<font color=#043E79FF>access network storage and compute</font>

110
00:06:20,455 --> 00:06:23,458
<font color=#043E79FF>almost like I plug in to a power outlet.</font>

111
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:25,207
<font color=#043E79FF>I don't care where it's at.</font>

112
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,956
<font color=#043E79FF>I just care that it works.</font>

113
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:29,959
<font color=#043E79FF>And that's that's all I really care about,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>is that it works.</font>

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,632
<font color=#043E79FF>Right? And that I can rapidly provision</font>

115
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,437
<font color=#043E79FF>the resources</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I need to get my compute done.</font>

116
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:38,407
<font color=#043E79FF>And, and there's several different,</font>

117
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,707
<font color=#043E79FF>and we'll talk about</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>the essential characteristics and,</font>

118
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:43,753
<font color=#043E79FF>and service models</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that, that are available.</font>

119
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:46,756
<font color=#043E79FF>And there's more service models</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>we're starting to see emerge.</font>

120
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,340
<font color=#043E79FF>All right.</font>

121
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,815
<font color=#043E79FF>Let's look at the definition.</font>

122
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,300
<font color=#043E79FF>Let's parse it out a little bit.</font>

123
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,313
<font color=#043E79FF>Model. Right.</font>

124
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,316
<font color=#043E79FF>It's an abstract of the framework,</font>

125
00:06:57,745 --> 00:07:00,748
<font color=#043E79FF>that is enabling the following technology</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>ubiquity,</font>

126
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,553
<font color=#043E79FF>which means it can come from anywhere.</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>It's pervasive.</font>

127
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:06,193
<font color=#043E79FF>It's everywhere convenient.</font>

128
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:10,945
<font color=#043E79FF>This is critical that I can easily spin up</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and tear down</font>

129
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:15,367
<font color=#043E79FF>what I need to get my job</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>done, and I can do it on demand.</font>

130
00:07:15,697 --> 00:07:20,185
<font color=#043E79FF>I can't say, oh, I'm going to provision</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>this and wait, 2 or 3 weeks</font>

131
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:24,178
<font color=#043E79FF>or 3 or 4 months to get the resources</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I need to do my job.</font>

132
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,752
<font color=#043E79FF>That's the old way</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that things used to work.</font>

133
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:28,468
<font color=#043E79FF>Actually, in the data centers,</font>

134
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:32,362
<font color=#043E79FF>you'd write up a full, business plan</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>on why you needed the equipment.</font>

135
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,431
<font color=#043E79FF>You had network architectures,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>you had all that stuff.</font>

136
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:37,411
<font color=#043E79FF>And then, proposal would go in.</font>

137
00:07:37,411 --> 00:07:40,975
<font color=#043E79FF>A budget would be approved</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>in three months later, you'd get servers,</font>

138
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:42,922
<font color=#043E79FF>to run your website.</font>

139
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,440
<font color=#043E79FF>That's how it used to work.</font>

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,895
<font color=#043E79FF>Now I can go in and quickly,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>over the internet,</font>

141
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,053
<font color=#043E79FF>I can quickly provision</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>a web server in a matter of,</font>

142
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,726
<font color=#043E79FF>30s. Maybe a minute.</font>

143
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,729
<font color=#043E79FF>And I'm off to the races.</font>

144
00:07:58,729 --> 00:07:59,917
<font color=#043E79FF>Okay.</font>

145
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,336
<font color=#043E79FF>Resources.</font>

146
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:04,207
<font color=#043E79FF>Another interesting, verb in there.</font>

147
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:07,177
<font color=#043E79FF>Resources.</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>A variety of different resources.</font>

148
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:09,619
<font color=#043E79FF>And we're seeing new resources here.</font>

149
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,622
<font color=#043E79FF>Storage network, compute accelerators</font>

150
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:16,681
<font color=#043E79FF>and, and some other interesting resources</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that we're starting to see.</font>

151
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:20,476
<font color=#043E79FF>AI is resource, other tools</font>

152
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:23,479
<font color=#043E79FF>and platforms as a resource,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>which we'll get into in a little bit.</font>

153
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:26,977
<font color=#043E79FF>Also, the other concept here</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that's very different from cloud,</font>

154
00:08:26,977 --> 00:08:30,739
<font color=#043E79FF>from grid computing is cloud</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>computing said there was</font>

155
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:34,369
<font color=#043E79FF>a shared pool of resources</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>with grid computing.</font>

156
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,636
<font color=#043E79FF>I had a shared pool,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>but it was allocated to me</font>

157
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:40,705
<font color=#043E79FF>for a certain period of time.</font>

158
00:08:40,705 --> 00:08:43,708
<font color=#043E79FF>With cloud computing, I have a shared pool</font>

159
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,074
<font color=#043E79FF>and I'm sharing the resource</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>with other people all the time now.</font>

160
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,968
<font color=#043E79FF>You can't get dedicated resources,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>but you're still sharing network.</font>

161
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:52,618
<font color=#043E79FF>You're still sharing things like that.</font>

162
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:52,915
<font color=#043E79FF>All right.</font>

163
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,918
<font color=#043E79FF>So that's that's important to understand.</font>

164
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:59,086
<font color=#043E79FF>The other thing that's important</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>in cloud is configurability.</font>

165
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:03,112
<font color=#043E79FF>So that I can take a machine,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I can install the OS</font>

166
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:07,435
<font color=#043E79FF>I want on it, I can configure it the way</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I want with users and all that stuff.</font>

167
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:11,296
<font color=#043E79FF>Very different from great computing,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>where it's a set of,</font>

168
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,629
<font color=#043E79FF>operating systems</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that are already on there. You,</font>

169
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:19,249
<font color=#043E79FF>ran jobs on that operating system</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>with cloud computing.</font>

170
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,044
<font color=#043E79FF>I'm actually running a virtual machine.</font>

171
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:23,638
<font color=#043E79FF>Right.</font>

172
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:26,641
<font color=#043E79FF>I have a full operating system on there.</font>

173
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:29,512
<font color=#043E79FF>Instead of just running an individual job,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>I'm running a full</font>

174
00:09:29,512 --> 00:09:32,515
<font color=#043E79FF>operating system.</font>

175
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,419
<font color=#043E79FF>Okay, the other really important thing</font>

176
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,719
<font color=#043E79FF>was this whole concept of rapidly the,</font>

177
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:42,085
<font color=#043E79FF>deploying and provisioning when I need it.</font>

178
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:45,880
<font color=#043E79FF>Now, we've seen, problem recently in this,</font>

179
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,642
<font color=#043E79FF>specifically in, instances that are,</font>

180
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:54,130
<font color=#043E79FF>in high demand, the waiting queues</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>can be up to three weeks right now</font>

181
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:57,331
<font color=#043E79FF>in a lot of the cloud service providers</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>that are out there.</font>

182
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:01,027
<font color=#043E79FF>But that's, normally not the case.</font>

183
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:04,888
<font color=#043E79FF>The other important thing is that</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>it would be minimal management required.</font>

184
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:08,749
<font color=#043E79FF>So all the management,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>the physical management of the devices</font>

185
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:13,171
<font color=#043E79FF>are outside of my control now,</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>but I can easily pre-provision machines</font>

186
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:17,626
<font color=#043E79FF>and get them spun up quickly</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>with little, management effort at all.</font>

187
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:19,012
<font color=#043E79FF>That's the whole idea behind it.</font>

188
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:21,421
<font color=#043E79FF>Okay,</font>

189
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,612
<font color=#043E79FF>here's the five essential characteristics</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>on demand service,</font>

190
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:29,671
<font color=#043E79FF>broadband</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>network access, resource pooling.</font>

191
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:32,905
<font color=#043E79FF>And the resource pooling has a lot to do</font>

192
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:35,908
<font color=#043E79FF>with the business model</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>more than anything else.</font>

193
00:10:35,974 --> 00:10:37,492
<font color=#043E79FF>I will talk about that.</font>

194
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:41,023
<font color=#043E79FF>And then, rapid elasticity</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>where I can scale up</font>

195
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,917
<font color=#043E79FF>and scale down quickly</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>and then that I it's measurable service</font>

196
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:48,877
<font color=#043E79FF>so that I'm able to see</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>how much I am using,</font>

197
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,441
<font color=#043E79FF>how much it's cost to me and the</font>
<font color=#043E79FF>performance that I'm getting out of it.</font>
