1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,553
In a previous lecture, we
talked about cloud computing in general.

2
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:05,939
Let's talk about the enablers.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,569
What really happened
to make this really, thrive

4
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:12,572
and why it's so ubiquitous today.

5
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:15,179
So to go there, we got to go back.

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,796
Let's go back in history.

7
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:19,964
And now you're going to hear Darren,
our doctor, Darren,

8
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:23,132
wax eloquently about the times in the 90s,

9
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:26,300
the great 90s, right, in Silicon Valley.

10
00:00:27,587 --> 00:00:33,065
I happened to be in an organization
that, was taking advantage of cloud

11
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:36,596
computing before it was called cloud
computing was called grid computing,

12
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,995
which was all about high performance
computing.

13
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:43,526
And there were, standard body
that I was a part of.

14
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,529
I was a chairman
of a couple working groups.

15
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,390
And, it was really cool

16
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:53,756
because we had academia and business
all working together

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,145
to see how we could take, computers
that were scattered all over the world

18
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:02,072
and have them work together to solve
problems, which was really, really cool.

19
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:05,141
And not only all

20
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:09,068
over the world, but then we also looked
at high performance computers

21
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,401
that, you know, for
the first time were doing,

22
00:01:12,533 --> 00:01:14,975
terabyte,

23
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,493
you know, terabytes of data.

24
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,813
It was crazy, right?

25
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,859
At the time, we thought it was so cool.

26
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,268
We're doing teraflops.
Wow. We're so fast now.

27
00:01:22,268 --> 00:01:24,116
We're talking x of flops today.

28
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:28,307
But grid computing was the foundation
of cloud computing where it has today.

29
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:31,508
In the early 2000, we saw that

30
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,511
there were some limitations
to, cloud computing.

31
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:37,712
They were great for batch processing,
for doing,

32
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:43,850
simulations of weather, nuclear
explosions, and lots of other, you know,

33
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:48,899
high, security things
for government and energy and research.

34
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:52,496
But how can I use that for my, day
to day work?

35
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:57,149
And that's where where,
we had to really start looking at things.

36
00:01:57,347 --> 00:02:00,350
And remember
I mentioned in, in other courses,

37
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,815
great computing
focused on running individual jobs

38
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,554
and enterprises.

39
00:02:06,554 --> 00:02:10,514
They do run jobs, but they run
applications in the whole ecosystems.

40
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:14,606
And and their workflows are very complex
compared to high performance computing

41
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:19,424
where the workflows are, much simpler,
maybe 5 or 6 steps.

42
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:21,635
But I need to run it a million times.

43
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:21,866
Right?

44
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,869
So that's that's a big difference
between the two.

45
00:02:25,529 --> 00:02:25,925
Okay.

46
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:30,248
In the mid 2000s,
the whole concept, cloud concept evolved

47
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:33,746
from the grid computing into
now let's take a look.

48
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:37,244
And with the advent of virtualization
things started,

49
00:02:37,343 --> 00:02:39,290
you know, really happening.

50
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,359
And it means that I could spin up
these VMs

51
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:45,857
instead of running individual jobs,
I could run a VM on this machine.

52
00:02:46,154 --> 00:02:49,685
And things like that started
happening in 2006.

53
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,229
AWS launches, however, Amazon launches
Amazon Web Services.

54
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,879
They even call Amazon Cloud.

55
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,651
At the time,
it was, say, Amazon Web Services.

56
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:01,895
And what was really

57
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:05,657
cool about this in the beginning is
I could have

58
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:09,089
I could take that virtualization concept
and the grid concept

59
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,475
and mesh them together.

60
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:13,478
And I could go easily spin up

61
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:17,636
instances of my infrastructure
on someone else's infrastructure,

62
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:18,923
which was really cool.

63
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:21,926
And then I only paid
for how much I used it.

64
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:25,292
Right. And so that was that was huge.

65
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,998
And then from there
that's called infrastructure as a service.

66
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:30,209
We'll get into that
a little bit more detail.

67
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,113
But from there that we started

68
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,446
seeing platforms as a service
and then software as a service.

69
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:40,373
So I didn't even need to buy licenses
for software, I didn't need to manage it.

70
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:45,092
I could just buy a VM that had
the licensing, had everything on it.

71
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:49,052
I could spin that up, run
my stuff, and I was off to the races.

72
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:52,550
So this really decrease the amount of time
it took for me

73
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,675
to build up the infrastructure
and deploy the software and manage that.

74
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,391
That could all happen.

75
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:02,615
And someone
else's infrastructure was very cool and.

76
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:05,816
All right, so let's take a look at the
at the real history.

77
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,433
Let's get down into the nitty gritty.

78
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:11,888
In the early days of shared, utility

79
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:17,003
or grid computing, there were a couple key
players, Sun Grid engine.

80
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:20,138
So Sun Microsystems had a killer product.

81
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:23,339
Sun Grid Engine
or Sun Grid was the free version.

82
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,725
Sun grid engine.

83
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:30,170
You could rent space from Sun Microsystems
on these really fast at the time.

84
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:32,975
Really fast. Servers.

85
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:36,242
And I was charged by the CPU

86
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:38,222
time.

87
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:43,139
So if my job was sitting there idle,
I didn't get I didn't get dinged,

88
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,142
I didn't have to pay for it,
but I paid for CPU time.

89
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:49,772
This was very similar
to what had been done with mainframes.

90
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,752
This sounds a lot like mainframes.

91
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:55,877
I used to be able to rent time on a
mainframe, and I got charged for CPU time.

92
00:04:55,877 --> 00:05:00,101
That's how much time is my process
actually using the CPU?

93
00:05:00,563 --> 00:05:03,038
There were others
that were in this as well.

94
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,866
HPE Utility
data Center, IBM on Demand computing,

95
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,595
DSA was another one.

96
00:05:10,595 --> 00:05:13,598
And then one of my favorite ones
was sitting at home

97
00:05:13,862 --> 00:05:17,129
and said he, was actually super,
super cool.

98
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,112
I actually got to watch,
the control center said at home was,

99
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:27,095
totally awesome, but said he at home
was the search for extraterrestrial life.

100
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,054
And they use people's laptops

101
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,552
and, and there was a sweaty running board,

102
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:38,677
a leaderboard who was giving
the most cycles to find this stuff.

103
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:41,812
So all you did
was you installed this little piece

104
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:46,069
of software on your laptop,
and, it ran a screensaver.

105
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
And then in the background

106
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,877
it would download data
from a central repository and then

107
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:55,507
crunch on that data on your laptop
and then send the results back.

108
00:05:55,837 --> 00:05:57,454
Kind of scary when you think about it.

109
00:05:57,454 --> 00:06:01,744
Oh, someone's downloading
data on my computer using my CPU,

110
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:05,275
generating new data
and then sending that data back out.

111
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,245
I was kind of crazy that we let people do
that.

112
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:10,720
Companies I it was crazy.

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,723
At the height of it, companies
were on the leaderboard.

114
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:18,013
Companies would set up, all machines
to just run steady at home

115
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:21,379
and, so they could be
on the top of the leaderboard.

116
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:25,108
It was, it was, it was a, it was a thing
back in the 90s and early 2000,

117
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:28,177
that kind of went away

118
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:31,477
because people were worried
about cyber security all of a sudden, oh,

119
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,777
I have someone else's software
running on my box,

120
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,087
receiving and sending data back and forth.

121
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,199
I love Little Fishy. Right?

122
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,509
So people were worried about that.

123
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,334
Okay.

124
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:46,294
Before AWS hosting,
some some things started to merge,

125
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,792
very similar to what AWS does today.

126
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:51,640
Loud cloud.

127
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,897
Rackspace managed hosting
did virtualize things

128
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:59,923
Inca and then Enki, and then Intel cloud.

129
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:03,817
Intel have one of the first cloud
cloud services that were out there

130
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,833
where you could actually deploy VMs
and run them and all that,

131
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,354
that Intel engineers actually helped
Amazon

132
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:16,918
build up, build up their solution. Right.

133
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,657
There were, some others, Sun Grid, Google,

134
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,848
had early
stuff there and so did Microsoft.

135
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:26,653
But AWS did something really interesting.

136
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:30,481
And to understand what they did, let's
talk about how anybody else got started.

137
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,144
Doctor Werner Vogels
I know him personally.

138
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:37,114
I worked with him in the open grid forum.

139
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:41,371
He gets hired by Amazon
to help to build up cloud computing,

140
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,397
architecture to handle the bursting
workloads that happened

141
00:07:45,397 --> 00:07:49,390
during the Christmas rush at Amazon,
which is November to December.

142
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:53,647
They had infrastructure, but it wasn't
being used highly effectively.

143
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:56,980
And why not go to cloud
computing or grid computing?

144
00:07:57,211 --> 00:08:00,214
Because grid computing was really good

145
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,867
at handling really large,
massively parallel amounts of of work.

146
00:08:05,197 --> 00:08:07,870
So Warner,

147
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,609
he, he did a lot of research in this area

148
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:13,777
and worked, with us in global
grid form quite a bit.

149
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:18,628
And, he took a lot of,
his research and learning and teaching

150
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:24,205
Amazon and, created what is today Amazon.

151
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:26,647
AWS, Amazon

152
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:29,650
Web Services, which is really,
really cool.

153
00:08:29,716 --> 00:08:33,808
Now, one thing that was different
about Amazon, what they did

154
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,009
was they first
got their own house in order.

155
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:40,210
How can I handle running all all of these,

156
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:44,566
capacity bursting
that happens during November and December.

157
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,800
And they figured that out
and they said, hey,

158
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,110
what do we do with all these spare cycles?

159
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,354
We have the rest of the ten months
out of the year.

160
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:55,357
Why don't we do something
like steady at home?

161
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,548
Why don't we do like what we're starting
to see with grid sun grid engine,

162
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,881
where you tell me where I can rent CPU's,

163
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,016
from, Amazon during all that time.

164
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:11,065
So Amazon could recoup some of the cost
that it took to manage and to run,

165
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:13,606
their data centers.

166
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:15,751
So that's brilliant. Right.

167
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:18,754
Here's
where things got really interesting.

168
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:22,747
They, they decided
instead of charging for CPU time,

169
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,179
because that's the only thing
that people were really charging for.

170
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,951
They were going to charge for network

171
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,954
and storage and CPU,

172
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:35,122
but instead of charging, absolutely.

173
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:39,973
How much you were using on the CPU,
they decided to charge for wall

174
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:40,930
clock time.

175
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,933
So how long has your,

176
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:47,299
have has your VM been running,

177
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:50,665
whether it's running or not,
how long have you had it installed?

178
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,879
Now, this is brilliant
because not everyone uses their,

179
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:59,476
their VMs in Amazon all the time.

180
00:10:00,202 --> 00:10:03,337
And a lot of people,
they were actually polluting,

181
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,934
polluting the data center
with all these zombie,

182
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:09,739
virtual machines
that were running out there.

183
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:09,970
Right.

184
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,247
So that's a problem
when you've got all these on

185
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:14,425
because you're taking up resources.

186
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,451
But no one was paying for those resources
in the old model, in this new model,

187
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,804
you paid for the resources.

188
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:23,797
Because you're you're using up memory
and things like that.

189
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:26,569
And, but you're not using the CPU.

190
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:27,955
But I'm still going to charge you

191
00:10:27,955 --> 00:10:30,958
for having that sitting there
using some of the resources.

192
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,258
So that's that's pretty cool, right?

193
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,568
Warnock took that business model

194
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:39,802
and ran with it
and became the cloud evangelist.

195
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:40,297
Right.

196
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,904
The cloud the whole cloud concept
started with Warner.

197
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:44,257
It was super cool right?

198
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:47,986
He became the CTO of Amazon
Global Evangelist.

199
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:51,748
He started showing up to the Global grid
forums touting cloud, cloud, cloud.

200
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:55,840
And then there was the starting
of a whole bunch of cloud conferences.

201
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,150
That continue today.

202
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,503
Which is, which is really cool.

203
00:10:59,503 --> 00:11:03,330
So the thing that made this viable,
that didn't make grid computing

204
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,026
as viable as a consumer,
we still use grid computing

205
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:10,161
and all the high performance computing
clusters out there is that concept.

206
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:13,428
Still, there are still valuable,
very valuable in research.

207
00:11:13,725 --> 00:11:18,015
But the business model
made this highly profitable for Amazon

208
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:21,942
because I started charging for,

209
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,770
wall clock time instead of just CPU time.

210
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,255
That was the big, big one.

211
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:30,126
They also charge for storing data

212
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:33,096
and moving data in and out of their cloud.

213
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:33,921
Right.

214
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:36,528
Which everyone knows the egress costs.

215
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:40,686
Moving data out of the cloud costs
more cost nothing to move it in the cloud.

216
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:43,656
But retrieving and getting out costs
substantial.

217
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:44,844
Right.

218
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:49,596
So this business model made it
so that, they could grow, right?

219
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:50,586
They could invest more.

220
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:53,556
And everyone was getting a lot of value
out of it.

221
00:11:53,688 --> 00:11:54,150
Right?

222
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,176
Because I didn't have to go spend millions
of dollars building a data center.

223
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:01,410
I could lease space from Amazon

224
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:05,502
at a very reduced cost, initial cost,

225
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:09,363
and which made it great for startups
and businesses

226
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,554
that were doing a digital transformation
but didn't have the knowhow

227
00:12:13,554 --> 00:12:16,095
or didn't have the capital to spend on it.

228
00:12:16,095 --> 00:12:16,887
All right.

229
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:20,286
What this meant was that Amazon,
if I spun up

230
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:23,256
in, a VM on a individual box,

231
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,787
they could optimize their CPU utilization,

232
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,209
dramatically by taking those VMs
that weren't being used

233
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,994
and just suspending them, not having them,
you know, having them in

234
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,954
virtual memory instead of in real memory
and setting those aside.

235
00:12:39,954 --> 00:12:44,046
So you had multiple people
running on the same, box,

236
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,587
which increased utilization
of the hardware.

237
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:51,471
And everything's everything's great all
around, decreasing amount of power used.

238
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,672
All that stuff happened through
this, which was pretty cool.

239
00:12:56,388 --> 00:12:57,180
All right.

240
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,886
Out of this became three basic service
models.

241
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,998
There's actually more models
that have been built after that.

242
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:05,001
But let's talk about the three basic
service models,

243
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,103
at the top, software as a service.

244
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:12,426
So as I mentioned, before, software
as a service is something like,

245
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:16,584
Google Cloud or Google
Calendar, Google Docs,

246
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,544
SAP in AWS,

247
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:23,844
SAP Hana,
that software as a service type of thing.

248
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:27,276
And a lot of people move to it. Workday.

249
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:31,203
People saw that a lot of companies
went to this model, right.

250
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:36,714
Because it meant that,
the software providers could easily manage

251
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:38,859
software for you.

252
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,532
You paid for it.

253
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:45,393
For, the use that you made every,
every month.

254
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:49,056
Typically you rented it for a month,
and then it

255
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:52,356
it made it much more flexible
for the consumer as well.

256
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:54,798
So highly valuable.

257
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:58,164
Netflix is another great
example of software as a service, right?

258
00:13:58,164 --> 00:14:00,144
I mean, everyone uses Netflix.

259
00:14:00,144 --> 00:14:01,233
I use that service.

260
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,906
I'm not I'm not paying to host machine.

261
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:07,140
I'm not paying to host, videos
on my servers.

262
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:09,516
I'm using Netflix to do that.

263
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,321
And there's additional services
that come from it.

264
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:16,413
If you go the step below this, the next
one is called platform as a service.

265
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:22,122
So platform as a service is used a lot of
times by independent software vendors.

266
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:23,541
S fees

267
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:27,699
because they want to host, they want to
host their software as a service.

268
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,593
But platform as a service means, hey,
there's infrastructure

269
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:33,045
set up there for me to do it.

270
00:14:33,045 --> 00:14:36,015
Build servers, a lamp stack,

271
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:39,150
which is, a Linux, web.

272
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,130
It's like a web server.

273
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,516
That's the best way to think of it.

274
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,826
It's a web server with a backend database,

275
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:49,116
but there's lots of other really cool
platforms as a service that,

276
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,393
decrease the

277
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,495
complexity of setting up my own
infrastructure,

278
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:58,587
to, host my own software type thing.

279
00:14:59,346 --> 00:14:59,511
Right.

280
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,745
So this is software that's sitting there
that makes it easier

281
00:15:03,273 --> 00:15:06,276
to host software and manage software
and things like that.

282
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,817
Lots of examples out there.

283
00:15:08,817 --> 00:15:12,546
And then underneath
that is the one that I started with,

284
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:17,133
which is infrastructure as a service
or IaaS as, as you'll hear before,

285
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:21,588
this is spinning up
VMs, network storage, right.

286
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,657
Infrastructure that I run my software on.

287
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,614
Right.

288
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:28,848
New models are coming out
like function as a service,

289
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:30,729
I as a service, blah blah blah.

290
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,897
As I say, the list goes on and on,
and we'll talk about some of those

291
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,900
other models in other lectures.

292
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,956
Okay.

293
00:15:37,956 --> 00:15:40,959
Best way to look at the service models
I love this,

294
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:43,896
this whole concept, this diagram,

295
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:46,635
if I look at software as a service,

296
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:50,826
it has applications, data, runtime
middleware, OS virtualization,

297
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:56,898
all the the whole stack done
platform as a service means that

298
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,188
I'm going to manage my applications
and my data, but everything else

299
00:16:01,188 --> 00:16:04,719
underneath the covers is managed for me
by somebody else.

300
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,920
Okay, infrastructure as a service

301
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,923
goes all the way down to the OS layer,

302
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:11,781
right?

303
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,784
So infrastructure as a service means I'm

304
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,787
going to give you all the virtualization
server storage network.

305
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:20,196
I'm going to manage

306
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:23,298
OS, middleware,
runtime data and applications.

307
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:28,611
So this diagram really shows you
that the simplicity of these models.

308
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:29,700
Right.

309
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,702
And and who's responsible for what.

310
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:35,903
Okay.

311
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,807
As we see all these things
kind of building up,

312
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:42,206
you can see that
the consumer on the back end,

313
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,265
can either pay Amazon for software
as a service.

314
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:49,466
Amazon has some software out there
at Google does right.

315
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:52,865
And AWS or Microsoft does.

316
00:16:52,865 --> 00:16:54,878
Oracle does.

317
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:59,762
And I pay more for software as a service
than I pay for platform as a service

318
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:03,986
and infrastructure as a service,
but they all build on top of each other.

319
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:07,451
So platform as a service builds
on top of infrastructure

320
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,751
software
as a service builds on top of platform.

321
00:17:11,015 --> 00:17:14,018
I can consume at any layer that I want,

322
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:17,780
but the value increases as I go up
the value chain and so does the cost.

323
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:21,443
Okay,

324
00:17:21,443 --> 00:17:24,446
we've talked about the different modes.

325
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,921
Let's talk about deployment models.

326
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,924
When we think of cloud
we always think of public cloud.

327
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,653
But in reality there's lots of different
deployment models.

328
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:35,204
There's a private cloud.

329
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:39,593
So I can take the same concepts
that were developed at AWS

330
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:44,279
and Google and Intel
and you know, Microsoft.

331
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,985
I can bring those into my own data center.

332
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:49,988
Now people go, well, Darren,
you already mentioned that,

333
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:53,981
hey, we go to cloud because I don't need
the capital expenditure.

334
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,512
But as your company grows,
you have to look at the price,

335
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,746
performance and price cost analysis.

336
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,198
It might be cheaper for you

337
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:05,960
to actually buy machines
and run your own private cloud,

338
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:08,798
where you're not renting
your equipment out to someone else,

339
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,032
but you're managing it in the way
the clouds are managed.

340
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:15,827
So everything is self-service
and things and things like that.

341
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,599
You can run that totally on prem.

342
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,942
Then we have the concept
of community clouds,

343
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,869
which have taken taken root
in some in some industries.

344
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,697
Maybe I don't want my cloud accessible
by everyone.

345
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:32,789
So I want to create my own community
cloud where I'm sharing with,

346
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:36,716
let's say it's, medical facility, right?

347
00:18:37,145 --> 00:18:39,917
And maybe a medical, group. I've got,

348
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,778
Community Cloud
here where I've got several different

349
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:47,342
organizations contributing to a cloud
and managing that cloud.

350
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:50,609
These are these didn't turn out as popular
as I thought they might.

351
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,744
Public cloud we've already talked about.

352
00:18:53,744 --> 00:18:55,361
This is global.

353
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:57,704
There's, you know, I can use it anywhere.

354
00:18:57,704 --> 00:19:01,862
The area that we're moving into
now is this hybrid cloud which says,

355
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:05,657
I've got a private cloud and
I'm going to use a public cloud together.

356
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:09,221
And these architectures
are really interesting.

357
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,224
And they give you the best of both worlds.

358
00:19:12,257 --> 00:19:15,755
I can invest and keep all of my

359
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,220
private data
and all my security in my private cloud,

360
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:23,015
and I can use a public cloud
for bursting in different types

361
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:24,335
of applications over there.

362
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,899
So this gives me that flexibility
of moving my,

363
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:33,179
workloads between private and public cloud
based off of different criteria,

364
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,624
whether it's, compliance criteria or it
could be cost, whatever the case may be.

365
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:42,023
And then the penultimate

366
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:45,026
of all of this
would be the multi hybrid cloud,

367
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,425
where now my workloads can move
across multiple public

368
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:52,187
clouds across multiple private clouds
and even community clouds.

369
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,487
And we're going to talk about those,
those different architectures,

370
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,312
during this course.
