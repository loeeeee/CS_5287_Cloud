# CA0 – Manual Deployment (Any Cloud)

**Goal:** Build and verify the full IoT pipeline “by hand” on 3–4 VMs so you understand each component end-to-end. You will provision servers, install services, wire the data flows, enforce basic security, and document everything.

## What You Must Do

0. **Document your software stack**
    - Choose a reference stack (e.g., Kafka, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
    - Document the components and versions you will use.
    - This reference stack will be the one you use through the course. It is your choice. Choose wisely.

1. **Environment Provisioning**
    - Choose a cloud provider (Chameleon, AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem).
    - Create 3–4 VMs (≈2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM each), noting region, machine type, network/subnet.
    - **Record** VM names, IPs, and any provider defaults.

2. **Software Installation & Configuration**
    - Install a Pub/Sub hub (Kafka broker + ZooKeeper or equivalent).
    - Deploy your DB (MongoDB or CouchDB).
    - Launch a Processor container (e.g., inference or transform service).
    - Run 1–2 Producer containers (data simulator or replay image).
    - Ensure each service starts on boot and logs to a known location.

3. **Data Pipeline Wiring**
    - Create topics/queues, configure producer → broker → processor → DB flow.
    - Push sample messages and verify they appear in the database.
    - Capture at least one end-to-end test log or screenshot of successful records.

4. **Security Hardening**
    - Disable password login; enforce SSH key authentication only.
    - Restrict inbound firewall rules to only essential ports (e.g., 22, 9092, 27017).
    - Run containers as non-root users where supported.

5. **Documentation & Deliverables**
    - **README.md** in your `CA0/` folder listing:
        - VM specs (size, OS, IPs), image tags, and version numbers.
        - High-level steps executed (you may capture commands or UI screenshots).
        - Any deviations from the reference stack and the reason why.
    - **Network Diagram** showing subnets/CIDRs, open ports, and trust boundaries.
    - **Configuration Summary** table: component name, image/version, host, port.
    - **Demo Video** (1–2 minutes): recording of you running the producer, observing Kafka, processor, and verifying a DB entry.
    - **Screenshots** of critical milestones (VM creation, service status, security settings).

## How You Will Be Graded

- **Correctness & Completeness** (15%): all four pipeline stages installed, wired, and verified.
- **Security Controls** (15%): SSH key only, minimal open ports, non-root containers.
- **Documentation & Diagrams** (30%): clear README, up-to-date network diagram, config table.
- **Demo Quality** (5%): concise, shows full data flow.
- **Cloud-Modality Execution** (25%): proper use of chosen provider’s console or CLI.
- **Reproducibility & Clarity** (10%): another student could follow your README to rebuild.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Plan your network layout before VM creation.
- Automate repetitive steps in a simple script or note them clearly.
- Take screenshots as you go—don’t rely on memory.
- If you hit a version or compatibility issue, document the problem and your workaround.
- Keep your README self-contained; avoid external links that may break over time.
